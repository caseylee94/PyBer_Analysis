# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

 The purpose of this project is to compare the ride sharing data for different types of cities - rural, suburban, and urban to see how different parameters vary for each city type. To compare multiple parameters, a Dataframe was created to show the results side by side. Then a multiple line graph was created to further analyze the results of the total weekly fares for each type of city. Finally, a written summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer finishes this project.

## Results

 The dataframe showing the output of the different parameters per city type is shown below:

 Looking at this data it is obvious this ride sharing service is used the most in urban cities, the least in rural areas, and suburban cities seem to be right in the middle. The total rides for urban cities is 13 times larger than the total rides for rural areas. The number of drivers is 30 times higher in urban cities than rural areas and 6 times larger than the suburban cities. The total fares for urban cities is 9 times higher than rural areas and twice as high as in suburban areas. The average fare per ride is relatively close together, though it is $10 lower in urban areas than rural areas and $5 lower in urban cities than rural areas. The average fare per driver is much lower in urban areas than in rural or suburban.

## Conclusion

 Urban cities are where ride sharing services are used the most, which makes sense given the high density population and general difficulty involved in driving, parking, and having a car in cities. Also given the higher population it is likely that there would be more drivers and more competition amongst drivers, which is likely driving down the average fare per driver. This is probably not an issue for the company, the fees are lower in urban areas but given the high density and popularity of using this service 
 *Focus on advertisement and lowering rates in rural/suburban areas
 *Focus resources
