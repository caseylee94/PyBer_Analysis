# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

### The purpose of this project is to compare the ride sharing data for different types of cities - rural, suburban, and urban to see how different parameters vary for each city type. To compare multiple parameters, a Dataframe was created to show the results side by side. Then a multiple line graph was created to further analyze the results of the total weekly fares for each type of city. Finally, a written summary of how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer finishes this project.

## Results

### The dataframe showing the output of the different parameters per city type is shown below:
