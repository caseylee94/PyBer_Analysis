# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to remove the reading and math scores from Thomas High School for the 9th grade class because there is evidence of academic dishonesty. For this analysis, the scores for Thomas High 9th graders have been replaced with NaN and the analysis of the school district has been repeated with these scores taken out to determine how the scores were affecting the overall summary.
